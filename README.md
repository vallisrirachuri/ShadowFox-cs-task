Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed the Shadow Fox Internship beginner and intermediate-level cybersecurity challenges! This experience strengthened my skills in ethical hacking, network security, and penetration testing. Hereâ€™s what I worked on:

ðŸ”¹ Beginner Level Tasks: âœ… Port Scanning with Nmap â€“ Discovered open ports on a test website and analyzed security risks. âœ… Brute Force Directory Enumeration with Dirb â€“ Found hidden directories on a website. âœ… Traffic Interception with Wireshark â€“ Captured and analyzed login credentials over HTTP.

ðŸ”¹ Intermediate Level Tasks: âœ… Decrypting an Encrypted File â€“ Used VeraCrypt and hash cracking techniques to retrieve a secret code. âœ… Analyzing PE File with PE Explorer â€“ Found the entry point address of an executable file. âœ… Creating a Reverse Shell with Metasploit â€“ Established a remote connection to a Windows 10 machine in a virtual environment.

This internship has been a fantastic hands-on experience that deepened my understanding of cybersecurity tools and attack methodologies. Special thanks to Shadow Fox for the learning opportunity!

ðŸ›¡ Key Takeaways: ðŸ”¹ The importance of ethical hacking and penetration testing. ðŸ”¹ How network security vulnerabilities can be exploited and mitigated. ðŸ”¹ Real-world application of cybersecurity tools like Nmap, Wireshark,Â andÂ Metasploit.
